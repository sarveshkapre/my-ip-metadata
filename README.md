# My IP Metadata

Server-observed IP metadata + safe enrichment (ASN/prefix/rDNS) with explicit trust labeling.

See `plan.md` for the full spec and roadmap.

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- Privacy toggles are persisted via query string (no localStorage).
- Local smoke checks: `docs/SMOKE.md`
